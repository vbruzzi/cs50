# CS50 PROBLEM SET SOLUTIONS


### Week 1

week1 contains credit.c and mario.c. Credit validates a credit card number given by the user using Luhn's algorithm. Mario creates an ASCII pyramid of the user's choice of height.

### Week 2

week2 contains crack.c and vigenere.c. Crack bruteforces a password up to 5 letters that is encrypted using crypt(). Vigenere uses the Vigenere cipher to encrypt a string given by the user with a key given by the user.

### Week 3
 
week3 contains whodunit.c, that modifies the colors in a BMP to reveal a hidden message.

### Week 4

week4 contains dictionary.c, which puts a dictionary in a hash table and spell checks txt files.

### Week 5

week5 contains my portfolio with skills, courses & certifications, projects, and others, made using bootstrap, CSS3 and HTML5.

### Week 6

week 6 contains mario.py, hello.py, credit.py, crack.py, crack2.py and bleep.py. The first 5 are Python versions of previous C projects (crack has a direct port of the C code and a different Pythonic implementation in crack2). Bleep censors words that are in a censor file (.txt).
